## Task
The challenge was to recreate a page with a header, a main, a sidebar and a footer. And the header will at the top, footer at the bottom,
and main and empty at the same row so at the middle and there has to be a space between main and sidebar.

## Description
For html i use bootstrap with the html/css in this project where i create a box where i put the rows that have their text align at the center,
after that i use the bootstarp grid system and say to header and footer to be a full row,
then i create the main a div name empty for the space and the sidebar and define there width with the grid system so half of the row for main and a quarter for empty and sidebar and then the work is done for html.
And i define the background color of the elements (header, main, empty, sidebar, footer) and say to header that his font-weight is bold and i define for the box his height (i define it in auto).

## Installation
There was no installation required for this project.

## Usage
Like i said earlier it will create a web page with an empty space in it that use bootstrap grid system with text management and div management too.
